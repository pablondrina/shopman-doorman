"""
AuthCustomerResolver -- Production adapter backed by Customers.

Implements the CustomerResolver protocol by delegating to
shopman.guestman.services.customer for all customer lookup and creation.

This is the default adapter used when Auth runs alongside Customers
in the shopman-suite. It translates between Customers's Customer model
and Auth's AuthCustomerInfo dataclass.

Configure in settings (this is the default):
    DOORMAN = {
        "CUSTOMER_RESOLVER_CLASS": "shopman.doorman.adapters.guestman.AuthCustomerResolver",
    }

Requires shopman.guestman to be installed and available on the Python path.
